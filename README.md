# Getting-Started

It’s super quick to get a [PHP-Prefixer](https://php-prefixer.com/) project up and running. Install any library freely. PHP-Prefixer will manage your namespaces.

- **Use the same libraries across all platforms**: Develop your solutions using the same libraries for all the platforms you work in, specifically WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, Slim Framework, etc.
- **Composer + WordPress**: Use Composer for your WordPress projects. PHP-Prefixer will process the dependencies to run smoothly along with other third-party plug-ins.
- **Fully integrated with Git**: Declare your name space configuration and let the service produce the packages. No local installation. No Phars. No new dependencies.

## The prefixed project results

This is the source project to be prefixed.

The prefixed results can be found in this repository: https://github.com/PHP-Prefixer/Getting-Started_prefixed

## Documentation

The documentation about this sample code can be found here: https://php-prefixer.com/docs/guides/

This sample project is written based on Composer original documentation, [Basic usage / Autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading).

## How to test the project

To run this sample project, run the following command:

```sh
~$ php a-simple-test.php
